<h1><span class="sp1">The Smiler</span></h1>

<h2>By Albert Hernhunter</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Your name?"</span></p>

<p>"Cole. Martin Cole."</p>

<p>"Your profession?"</p>

<p>"A very important one. I am a
literary agent specializing in
science fiction. I sell the work of
various authors to magazine and
book publishers."</p>

<p>The Coroner paused to study
Cole; to ponder the thin, mirthless
smile. The Coroner said, "Mr. Cole,
this inquest has been called to look
into the death of one Sanford
Smith, who was found near your
home with a gun in his hand and
a bullet in his brain. The theory of
suicide has been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;rather hard to rationalize?"</p>

<p>The Coroner blinked. "You
could put it that way."</p>

<p>"I would put it even stronger.
The theory is obviously ridiculous.
It was a weak cover-up. The best I
could do under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"You are saying that you killed
Sanford Smith?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>The Coroner glanced at his six-man
jury, at the two police officers,
at the scattering of spectators. They
all seemed stunned. Even the reporter
sent to cover the hearing
made no move toward the telephone.
The Coroner could think of
only the obvious question: "Why
did you kill him?"</p>

<p>"He was dangerous to us."</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean by <i>us</i>?"</p>

<p>"We Martians, who plan to take
over your world."</p>

<p>The Coroner was disappointed. A
lunatic. But a lunatic can murder.
Best to proceed, the Coroner
thought. "I was not aware that we
have Martians to contend with."</p>

<p>"If I'd had the right weapon to
use on Smith, you wouldn't be aware
of it now. We still exercise caution."</p>

<p>The Coroner felt a certain pity.
"Why did you kill Smith?"</p>

<p>"We Martians have found
science-fiction writers to be our
greatest danger. Through the medium
of imaginative fiction, such
writers have more than once revealed
our plans. If the public suddenly
realized that&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The Coroner</span> broke in. "You
killed Smith because he revealed
something in his writings?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He refused to take my word
that it was unsalable. He threatened
to submit it direct. It was vital
material."</p>

<p>"But there are many other such
writers. You can't control&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We control ninety percent of
the output. We have concentrated
on the field and all of the science-fiction
agencies are in our hands.
This control was imperative."</p>

<p>"I see." The Coroner spoke in
the gentle tones one uses with the
insane. "Any writing dangerous to
your cause is deleted or changed by
the agents."</p>

<p>"Not exactly. The agent usually
persuades the writer to make any
such changes, as the agent is considered
an authority on what will
or will not sell."</p>

<p>"The writers always agree?"</p>

<p>"Not always. If stubbornness is
encountered, the agent merely
shelves the manuscript and tells the
writer it has been repeatedly rejected."</p>

<p>The Coroner glanced at the two
policemen. Both were obviously
puzzled. They returned the Coroner's
look, apparently ready to
move on his order.</p>

<p>The thin, mirthless smile was still
on Cole's lips. Maniacal violence
could lie just behind it. Possibly
Cole was armed. Better to play for
time&mdash;try to quiet the madness
within. The Coroner continued
speaking. "You Martians have infiltrated
other fields also?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. We are in government,
industry, education. We are everywhere.
We have, of course, concentrated
mainly upon the ranks of
labor and in the masses of ordinary,
everyday people. It is from these
sources that we will draw our
shock troops when the time comes."</p>

<p>"That time will be&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Soon, very soon."</p>

<p>The Coroner could not forebear
a smile. "You find the science-fiction
writers more dangerous than
the true scientists?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. The scientific mind
tends to reject anything science disproves."
There was now a mocking
edge to Cole's voice. "Science can
easily prove we do not exist."</p>

<p>"But the science-fiction writer?"</p>

<p>"The danger from the imaginative
mind cannot be overestimated."</p>

<p>The Coroner knew he must soon
order the officers to lay hands upon
this madman. He regretted his own
lack of experience with such situations.
He tried to put a soothing,
confidential note into his voice.
"You said a moment ago that if
you'd had the right kind of weapon
to use on Smith&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cole reached into his pocket and
brought out what appeared to be a
fountain pen. "This. It kills instantly
and leaves no mark whatever.
Heart failure is invariably
stated as the cause of death."</p>

<p>The Coroner felt better. Obviously,
Cole was not armed. As the
Coroner raised a hand to signal the
officers, Cole said, "You understand,
of course, that I can't let you
live."</p>

<p>"Take this man into custody."</p>

<p>The police officers did not move.
The Coroner turned on them sharply.
They were smiling. Cole pointed
the fountain pen. The Coroner felt
a sharp chill on his flesh. He looked
at the jury, at the newspaperman,
the spectators. They were all smiling
cold, thin, terrible smiles....</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;short</span> time later, the newspaperman
phoned in his story. The
afternoon editions carried it:</p>

<div class="bq"><p class="center">CORONER BELL DIES OF HEART ATTACK</p>

<p>Shortly after this morning's
inquest, which resulted in a
jury verdict of suicide in the
case of Sanford Smith, Coroner
James Bell dropped dead
of heart failure in the hearing
room of the County building.
Mr. Bell leaves a wife and&mdash;</p></div>
